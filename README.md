Miscellaneous
=============
This repository is a holder for stand alone files or very small projects.

This repo largely contains code that has no tests and is possibly half finished.
The code might have unfinished or buggy functions but every other function worked under my use conditions.
Although that's assuming I ran the code at all.


#Tests
As expected "src" contains the code and "tests" contain the tests.
The javascript tests run off of
[simple tester.js](https://github.com/SkySpiral7/Humans-and-Heroes/blob/wip/2-secret-origins/javascript/simple%20tester.js)
which is in my
[Humans & Heroes repository](https://github.com/SkySpiral7/Humans-and-Heroes).
