##UT_FileToStringAdapter.java
The JUnit test for FileToStringAdapter.java. It requires the files smallFile.txt and optionally largeFile.txt.

.gitignore exists for the sole purpose of excluding largeFile.txt because it is larger than 4GB.
If you would like to test using the large file, the UT includes a method to recreate it.
